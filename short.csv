Bohannon (1984) suggests that the salt could be either within the Muddy Creek Formation or in older buried Tertiary clastic rocks. The salt body is composed of halite crystals stratified with glauberite, clay and tuff and is as much as 500 m thick locally","Part of the Muddy Creek Formation. Mostly sandstone and siltstone but also includes evaporite deposits, limestone, conglomerate, breccia and rarely, tuff. Probably deposited in three separate basins within the quadrangle. Dates from the top of the formation all suggest a minimum age of about 5-6 Ma (see discussion below). Base of section not directly dated, but typically inferred to be younger than the red sandstone unit, about 10 Ma (Bohannon, 1984). Muddy Creek is unconformable on the red sandstone in most exposures, but in unexposed centers of the basins the contact may be gradational. The largest of the basins occurs in the northern part of Overton Arm and is the southern extension of the Muddy Creek basin originally defined in the Moapa-Mesquite area to the north of the Lake Mead quadrangle (Stock, 1921; Bohannon and others, 1993; Schmidt and others, 1996). A basalt flow interbedded near the top of the section at the southern end of this basin, near Overton Beach, is dated at about 6 Ma. A second sedimentary basin centered in the Virgin basin area in the southern part of the quadrangle locally includes Hualapai Limestone (Th) at the top (about 6 Ma). The Hualapai extends eastward from this basin across a bedrock high at Virgin Canyon and is flexed into a hanging-wall anticline against the Wheeler fault. It is possible that this southern basin was physically connected to the main Muddy Creek basin to the north, but bedrock outcrops and lack of Muddy Creek deposits in the intervening area suggest that deposition occurred in a separate basin. The third basin is in the western part of the quadrangle east of Frenchman Mountain where gypsum, limestone, and marl deposits interfinger with marginal sandstone and conglomerate. A tuff near the top of the section has a geochemical correlation age of 5.59 Ma (Tuff of Wolverine Creek; Castor and Faulds, 2001; reported as 6 Ma in Castor and others, 2000). This basin extended both south toward Boulder Basin and northward to Nellis basin (Castor and others, 2000). Large masses of salt (halite) occur in the northern Overton Arm, between Echo Bay and Overton Beach. Salt was originally exposed along the Virgin River, now buried by Lake Mead except for two outcrops south of Overton Beach (Mannion, 1963). The salt body is faulted to the west against the Roger Springs fault; its eastern limit is unknown but probably corresponds to a northeast elongate gravity low in Overton Arm that has been described as a structural pull- apart basin along the Lake Mead fault system. The salt has been inferred to be part of the Muddy Creek Formation, but it is possible that it is part of an older sequence of basin-fill deposits, most likely the Rocks of Overton Arm (Bohannon, 1984). The source of the salt is unknown; Mannion (1963) suggested that the salt was derived from Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks on the Colorado Plateau, deposited by an ancestral Virgin River to the Lake Mead area and deposited in the Overton Arm area.","Muddy Creek Formation, fine-grained facies",Muddy Creek Formation

Anderson (written communication, 2000) reinterpreted the deposit as a Thumb-age angular-clast conglomerate intruded by the pluton. Unit is about 400 m thick","The Horse Spring Formation is a pre- to syn-extension basin deposit defined by Longwell (1921, 1922) and divided into four members by Bohannon (1984). The four members are, in descending order, the Lovell Wash, Bitter Ridge Limestone, Thumb, and Rainbow Gardens Members. They range in age from as young as 13 Ma to about 24 Ma or older. Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution. Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005). We consider the revised range of the two upper members to be from 14.3 to 13.0 Ma. Bohannon (1984) bracketed the Thumb Member to be between 17.2 and 13.5 Ma in age. In the south Virgin Mountain area this unit is more tightly constrained between ~16.2 and 14.2 Ma (Beard, 1996). New 40Ar/39Ar dates on sanidine and biotite (Donatelle and others, 2005; Martin, 2005) from the Thumb Member within the Echo Wash area range from 16.4 (biotite) to 14.6 Ma (sanidine). We consider the Thumb Member age to be most likely between about 14.2 to 16.4 Ma. Beard (1996) recognized a disconformity to angular unconformity between the Thumb and underlying Rainbow Gardens Members. Although Bohannon considered the Rainbow Gardens Member to be no older than 20 Ma, Beard (1996) reported 40Ar/39Ar ages ranging from ~26.0 to less than 18.8 Ma in the South Virgin Mountains.

7441,0,Thb,middle and lower Miocene and upper Oligocene,Middle Miocene,487,Late Oligocene,485,"Exposed on the east side of Frenchman Mountain, at the southern end of California Wash, and in the Gale Hills and White Basin. Best exposures are at the type locality in the Bitter Ridge area in White Basin where it forms a prominent, very thick south-facing cliff that extends from Lovell Wash eastward to West Longwell Ridge. The member is almost exclusively a distinctive thick- bedded, algal-laminated limestone with teepee structures, oncolitic textures, and stromatolitic bioherms. At Lava Butte the member includes yellowish sandstone with some pebbly beds that interfingers with limestone beds near the top of the section, as well as a 6 m thick tuff bed and thin ash-flow tuff (Castor and others, 2000). The limestone pinches out northward and the unit is represented by the sandstone and tuff until it also pinches out between the Thumb and Lovell Wash Members. Along Lovell Wash the member includes sandstone and mudstone ‘red beds’ in the upper part above the main limestone cliff, overlain by borate-bearing limestone, both of which grade laterally to a conglomeratic facies that records faulting at the basin margin (Bohannon, 1984, Castor, 1993, Anderson, 2003). A similar clastic sequence is found above the main carbonate cliff at White Basin, which is also overlain by borate-bearing limestone. The borate deposits were mined in both the Lovell Wash and White Basin areas in the 1920’s (see Castor, 1993, for greater detail on the borate deposits). Bohannon (1984) placed the age of the Bitter Ridge Limestone at between about 13.5 and 13.0 Ma, based on fission track ages. Castor and others (2000) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 13.07 ± 0.08 Ma for an ash-flow tuff in the Bitter Ridge Limestone obtained south of Lava Butte, but this age is younger than ages they obtained for the ‘overlying’ Lovell Wash Member and they suggested the two members may be at least in part lateral equivalents. Donatelle and others (2005) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 14.32 ± 0.10 Ma (sanidine) from a thick, vitric tuff in the Bitter Ridge Limestone Member in the Echo Wash area. This is within the upper age range of the Thumb Member and suggests that the lower Bitter Ridge may be the same age as the uppermost Thumb Member in other areas","The Horse Spring Formation is a pre- to syn-extension basin deposit defined by Longwell (1921, 1922) and divided into four members by Bohannon (1984).

Kunk, written communication, 2000) just north of the Gold Butte fault, 13.92 ± 0.5 Ma in conglomerate just north of the Lime Ridge fault, and 14.4 ± 0.3 Ma at Horse Spring in clastic sediments overlying conglomerate derived from Gold Butte (40Ar/39Ar, Beard, 1996). Outcrop south of Hamblin Mountain and at the north end of Wilson Ridge is incompletely studied. Described by Naumann (1987) as a very poorly-sorted, matrix-supported breccia of angular to rounded clasts of rapakivi granite, quartz monzonite, gneiss, schist, sandstone, and dolomite. He interpreted the deposit to be a contact breccia formed by intrusion of Wilson Ridge pluton. Anderson (written communication, 2000) reinterpreted the deposit as a Thumb-age angular-clast conglomerate intruded by the pluton. Unit is about 400 m thick","The Horse Spring Formation is a pre- to syn-extension basin deposit defined by Longwell (1921, 1922) and divided into four members by Bohannon (1984). The four members are, in descending order, the Lovell Wash, Bitter Ridge Limestone, Thumb, and Rainbow Gardens Members. They range in age from as young as 13 Ma to about 24 Ma or older. Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution. Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005). We consider the revised range of the two upper members to be from 14.3 to 13.0 Ma. Bohannon (1984) bracketed the Thumb Member to be between 17.2 and 13.5 Ma in age. In the south Virgin Mountain area this unit is more tightly constrained between ~16.2 and 14.2 Ma (Beard, 1996). New 40Ar/39Ar dates on sanidine and biotite (Donatelle and others, 2005; Martin, 2005) from the Thumb Member within the Echo Wash area range from 16.4 (biotite) to 14.6 Ma (sanidine). We consider the Thumb Member age to be most likely between about 14.2 to 16.4 Ma. Beard (1996) recognized a disconformity to angular unconformity between the Thumb and underlying Rainbow Gardens Members. Although Bohannon considered the Rainbow Gardens Member to be no older than 20 Ma, Beard (1996) reported 40Ar/39Ar ages ranging from ~26.0 to less than 18.8 Ma in the South Virgin Mountains. Carpenter and others (1989) also reported a K/Ar age on biotite of 24.3 ± 1.0 Ma from a vitric tuff in the Rainbow Gardens Member in the northern Grand Wash trough","Horse Spring Formation, Thumb Member, conglomeratic rocks",Thumb Member
