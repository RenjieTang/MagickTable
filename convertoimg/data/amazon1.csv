With HDTV the resolution is so much better that you can sit closer to a larger TV without noticing the pixels. So with HDTVs the rule tends to be you can sit anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times the screen size in inches for the best experience.   If you know the size of the room you have already where you want to sit and where your new HDTV should go once you get it you can figure out the size HDTV you should get.

Simplicity and Performance   Four-Inch Grayscale Display   The PiranhaMAX 160 PT features a four-inch four-level grayscale display with 160 x 128 pixel resolution so you get a good view of the action--even in direct sunlight.   Simple Fishfinding   The PiranhaMAX extremely easy to use. For most anglers all you ll ever need to do is power on and fish.

Automatically determines depth and makes adjustments to keep the bottom and fish visible on the display.         Suction-cup transducer and rechargeable battery included so you can take it anywhere.      The PiranhaMAX uses sonar technology to send sound waves from the transducer into the water. The returned echoes are plotted on the display creating a very accurate picture of the underwater world including distance to underwater objects such as the bottom fish and structure.   Dual Beam Sonar   The PiranhaMAX 160 PT uses a 200 83 kHz dual beam sonar system with a wide 60 degree area of coverage. Dual Beam sonar is optimized to show the greatest bottom definition using a narrow 20 degree beam yet can still indicate fish found in the wide 60 degree beam when the Fish ID feature is turned on. Dual Beam is ideal for a wide range of conditions--from shallow to very deep water in both fresh and salt water. Note that boat speed wave action bottom hardness water conditions and transducer installation can all affect depth capability.   Fish ID Fish ID uses advanced sonar processing to interpret sonar returns and displays a Fish Symbol when very selective requirements are met. When a fish is detected a fish icon and its depth are displayed above the return that has been classified as being a fish. Three different fish icons represent intensity of the sonar return and provide an indicator of relative fish size.   Fish and Depth Alarms   When Fish ID is on you can set an alarm to sound when the PiranhaMAX detects fish that correspond to your settings. You can also set a depth alarm from 3 to 99 feet--an audible alarm sounds when the depth is equal to or less than the setting.   Ultra-Portable   The PT version of the PiranhaMAX 160 comes with a soft-shell carrying case suction cup transducer integral cable storage and a 7Ah battery and charger so you won t miss a fish no matter how far away from home you are.

Optical Image Stabilizer 78x Zoom  Advanced O.I.S.The new Enhanced Optical 78x Zoom has been added to the compact body of the easy-to-carry camcorder. By taking maximum advantage of the effective CCD area the camera makes it easy to capture a wide range of dynamic images from sweeping landscapes with the 33mm wide-angle scope to close-ups of distant subjects with the 78x zoom without having to worry about image degradation. However with long-distance zoom shots even a tiny bit of hand-shake has a huge effect on picture quality. That s where Advanced O.I.S. Optical Image Stabilizer comes in. It shifts a corrective lens as you shoot to help eliminate the effects of hand-shake so you get clear sharp shots even at high zoom levels. It s an essential feature for getting the most out of this incredible zoom lens.        33 mm Wide Angle and Advanced O.I.S.     33 mm WideThe 33mm wide-angle setting on the Standard Series fits more people and more of the background into the frame than conventional models. This is especially handy when you want to take a group photo in a small room. It fits your subjects in even when you shoot from up close and makes it possible to pick up even small sounds with the mic. 35mm camera equivalent    Advanced O.I.S. with Active Mode    Advanced O.I.S. with Active Mode comes in handy when shooting while walking or playing with your children.

Nothing has changed since its introduction--it still uses Reverse Polish Notation RPN is easy and versatile in programming and has a thin sturdy casing. Certainly there s been newer fancier calculators introduced since but there s something to be said for the quality of classics.  The HP 12C s functions include all the basics--such as calculating APR NPV and IRR--and statistics are a snap. For students new to financial calculators this is an excellent place to start. For the most part the manual reads like a minitextbook walking you through sample problems and situations followed by graphs and tables demonstrating the technique--and you can even check your results. The section on creating programs does seem to be written for the technically ignorant addressing in detail how you could possibly benefit from using programs but it ll still help you get the job done.  In general it s a bit slower than newer models just like last year s computer isn t as speedy as today s new release. On the plus side it s just 3 by 5 inches and slips easily into a pocket. The bottom is printed with a few little cheat notes for common functions which is nice for quick reference. The HP 12C s one-year warranty and available tech-support line offer reassurance this little workhorse will continue to be an industry standard for years to come.  --Jill Lightner     Pros Pocket size   Thorough and simple instruction manual   Competitive price      Cons Calculates more slowly than modern machines    What s in the Box   Calculator user s manual installed batteries and carrying case,5.0 x 3.1 x 0.6 inches,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41iicLqylwL._SL500_AA300_.jpg,8.8 ounces,1 pounds,,"<ul><li>Calculator with built-in financial functions and statistics</li> <li>Uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)</li> <li>More than 120 built-in functions, including register-based cash-flow analysis</li> <li>10-character, 1-line LCD display</li> <li>Device measures 5.0 x 0.6 x 3.1 inches (WxHxD)</li> </ul>"

All you need to do is connect the cable to USB ports on your old Windows XP or Vista computer to your new Windows 7 machine and run the utility.    Easily Transfer User Accounts PC Settings Files and More   Your user accounts Windows settings files and folders pictures and photos MP3s and other music videos program settings and program data and e-mail messages settings and contacts will all be transferred over to your new computer without a fuss. Thanks to the Map User Accounts feature the destination PC is not required to have matching User Accounts. Gone are the days of losing important email messages or having to reset all your user settings Once the transfer done a post migration report is generated which gives you a comprehensive view of everything that was transferred. Because of possible incompatibility issues programs and applications are not transferred to the new computer. Instead the utility provides a list of all the programs and applications that were installed on the old PC along with links to the latest versions of the programs if they are provided by the software developer.     Eight-foot USB 2.0 Cable with LED Indicators   The Easy Transfer Cable is eight feet long and has two auto-speed selectable USB type-A male connectors. The USB 2.0 Hi-Speed cable provides transfer speeds of up to 480Mbps and is fully backward compatible with USB 1.1. LEDs on the cable lets you quickly know that the transfers have begun.

A lot of thought went into creating an iPod nano that not only talks but says the right things. It all begins with iTunes and its seamless integration with iPod nano.

Just sync your iPod nano to your computer and it really speaks to you.    It Speaks Multiple Languages   Your music library has songs from all over the world--a love song from France a bolero from Spain a pop tune from Japan. Luckily VoiceOver speaks fluent song.   iTunes selects the language and best voice for your song titles and artist names. It looks at song data like the title artist and album information then applies intelligent algorithms to choose the right language. For example iTunes recognizes the song Ya Viene el Sol by Ozomatli as a Spanish song so your iPod nano will automatically speak that song title and artist in Spanish. If you prefer to hear that information spoken in another language you can change the designated VoiceOver language for that song in iTunes.

Great for a HTPC my implementation .   Don t expect miracles - this is a very capable APU using the new AMD F1 socket be careful installing the APU...lots of tiny pins and competes well with i3 or i5 processors. I tested it with CrossfireX enabled and disabled and definitely recommend adding the extra HD 6670 6570 or 6450 graphics card. Under normal use you would never know the difference - using HD 3D or intense graphics demands and the integrated HD 6650 gets stressed when working alone. For an AMD product this is one of the best yet. Being a usual Intel fan it was difficult to to steer away from my comfort zone. However the cost-savings to acceptable performance index was the factor that influenced my purchase. This product line is for you budget-builders The Windows Experience Index is 6.7 out of 7.9 for this build Processor 7.3 Memory 7.6 Graphics and Gaming Graphics 6.7 . I pulled my good hard drives out and put WD Caviar Blue 6.0 Gb s drives in for a cool and quiet HTPC unfortunately reducing the overall index to 5.9 just the hard drives . That is right the hard drives will hold you back...  Bottom-line Great processing power Excellent 3D capable 1080p graphics both Blu-ray or HD streaming built-in with full DirectX 11 support. I suggest taking advantage of the Hybrid CrossfireX Dual Graphics capability. Most HTPC builds will not require a discrete graphics card addition however. The average user will be impressed.

With virtually instant data access times SSDs also outperform traditional hard drives in data lookup file transfers and other disk-intensive work.           Longer Battery Life   Using an SSD with your notebook or netbook means you ll enjoy longer battery life. Traditional mechanical hard drives consume large amounts of power to start up and seek data. With no moving parts SSDs use less of your precious battery power resulting in longer running times.

The camera comes with CCD-shift image stabilization and HD Movie function as well as a long-life battery making it possible to take up to 580 shots on a single full charge. With this model Casio has also realized a fresh new digital camera design creating an innovative form finished in natural curves.    Casio EX-Z2000 Highlights     Newly developed EXILIM Engine 5.0   Casio has made even further advances from its EXILIM Engine 4.0 which contained both an ordinary CPU and a high-speed dedicated image processing CPU. The new Engine 5.0 increases image processing speed by 30 and produces beautiful images through advanced color reproduction and rich tonal gradation and by removing noise from photos in high sensitivity mode.    Dynamic Photo Make composite images of different moving images   Casio has achieved great advancements in Dynamic Photo a function that creates moving photos by cutting moving subjects from the background in images taken with continuous shooting and combining those images on a different still image. In addition to composites made with a still image background cut-out moving images can now be pasted on other moving images. This new capability raises the power of expression of images. Thus while increasing the fun of creating images these models will also increase the fun of sharing images by making it easy to upload images to YouTube using the included software or post them to a blog.

It simultaneously optimizes settings for exposure ISO sensitivity point of focus photo blur correction tonal range and color balance and level of noise reduction. Premium Auto is a state-of-the-art fully automatic function that makes it easy for users to take superior quality photos just by pushing the shutter button by analyzing the image at the level of individual pixels and performing different corrections for human subjects and the background.

Achieve Perfect Fit and Seal      Over-the-ear design keeps the M6 in place for an active lifestyle     In-Ear Fit Guide   Sound quality and bass response are dependent on the seal achieved between the ear tips and your ear canal. Please try the various sizes of ear tips included with your earphone to determine which gives you the best sound and comfort. The sound may change depending on the insertion depth and tip size.   First Use   The MEE M6 earphone is an over-the-ear earphones with memory wire and may take several minutes to get the MEE M6 positioned for the best sound. Adjusting how the memory wire is positioned insertion angle as well as tips are important for comfort and getting a proper seal. If you do not hear much bass you do not have a good seal. If the treble sounds harsh the earphone requires a deeper insertion. Six sets of ear tips have been provided to help you achieve the best seal and comfort possible please try the tips you think will fit your ear canal size best. Note different ear tips may change the sound you hear due to how deep they insert and how well they seal. Usually tips with more flanges offer better isolation.   Earphone Insertion   Each earphone is marked with a R for right and L for left channels. The MEE M6 channels are not swappable due to the design. Moistening your ear tips may make insertion easier. Pulling the upper part of your ear helix up and back while inserting your earphone opens your ear canal during insertion which may improve your ability to get a deep insertion at the proper angle.   Using the Memory Wire   The memory wire keeps the cable over your ear and in place so the M6 will not move around even during sports and activities. The memory wire is designed to be flexible and bent to the shape of your ear. The first time wearing the M6 put the driver housing in your ear and bend the memory wire around your ear to achieve a conforming fit. The memory wire will retain its shape for easier future installation. Repeatedly bending the memory wire at sharp angles will break the memory wire.   If you are still having issues or if you feel that your earphone just does not sound as you think it should please contact MEElectronics for more assistance.   Burn-In   Many owners have stated that the sound may improve with use when compared to the out of the box sound. This change in sound will occur with normal listening and is not necessary however you can accelerate this process by playing music at a normal volume continuously for the first several days called burn in.
