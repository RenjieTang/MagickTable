The salt body is composed of halite crystals stratified with glauberite, clay and tuff and is as much as 500 m thick locally","Part of the Muddy Creek Formation. Mostly sandstone and siltstone but also includes evaporite deposits, limestone, conglomerate, breccia and rarely, tuff. Probably deposited in three separate basins within the quadrangle. Dates from the top of the formation all suggest a minimum age of about 5-6 Ma (see discussion below). Base of section not directly dated, but typically inferred to be younger than the red sandstone unit, about 10 Ma (Bohannon, 1984). Muddy Creek is unconformable on the red sandstone in most exposures, but in unexposed centers of the basins the contact may be gradational. The largest of the basins occurs in the northern part of Overton Arm and is the southern extension of the Muddy Creek basin originally defined in the Moapa-Mesquite area to the north of the Lake Mead quadrangle (Stock, 1921; Bohannon and others, 1993; Schmidt and others, 1996). A basalt flow interbedded near the top of the section at the southern end of this basin, near Overton Beach, is dated at about 6 Ma. A second sedimentary basin centered in the Virgin basin area in the southern part of the quadrangle locally includes Hualapai Limestone (Th) at the top (about 6 Ma). The Hualapai extends eastward from this basin across a bedrock high at Virgin Canyon and is flexed into a hanging-wall anticline against the Wheeler fault. It is possible that this southern basin was physically connected to the main Muddy Creek basin to the north, but bedrock outcrops and lack of Muddy Creek deposits in the intervening area suggest that deposition occurred in a separate basin. The third basin is in the western part of the quadrangle east of Frenchman Mountain where gypsum, limestone, and marl deposits interfinger with marginal sandstone and conglomerate. A tuff near the top of the section has a geochemical correlation age of 5.59 Ma (Tuff of Wolverine Creek; Castor and Faulds, 2001; reported as 6 Ma in Castor and others, 2000). This basin extended both south toward Boulder Basin and northward to Nellis basin (Castor and others, 2000). Large masses of salt (halite) occur in the northern Overton Arm, between Echo Bay and Overton Beach. Salt was originally exposed along the Virgin River, now buried by Lake Mead except for two outcrops south of Overton Beach (Mannion, 1963). The salt body is faulted to the west against the Roger Springs fault; its eastern limit is unknown but probably corresponds to a northeast elongate gravity low in Overton Arm that has been described as a structural pull- apart basin along the Lake Mead fault system. The salt has been inferred to be part of the Muddy Creek Formation, but it is possible that it is part of an older sequence of basin-fill deposits, most likely the Rocks of Overton Arm (Bohannon, 1984). The source of the salt is unknown; Mannion (1963) suggested that the salt was derived from Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks on the Colorado Plateau, deposited by an ancestral Virgin River to the Lake Mead area and deposited in the Overton Arm area.","Muddy Creek Formation, fine-grained facies","Muddy Creek Formation"

Anderson (written communication, 2000) reinterpreted the deposit as a Thumb-age angular-clast conglomerate intruded by the pluton. Unit is about 400 m thick","The Horse Spring Formation is a pre- to syn-extension basin deposit defined by Longwell (1921, 1922) and divided into four members by Bohannon (1984). The four members are, in descending order, the Lovell Wash, Bitter Ridge Limestone, Thumb, and Rainbow Gardens Members. They range in age from as young as 13 Ma to about 24 Ma or older. Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution. Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005). We consider the revised range of the two upper members to be from 14.3 to 13.0 Ma. Bohannon (1984) bracketed the Thumb Member to be between 17.2 and 13.5 Ma in age. In the south Virgin Mountain area this unit is more tightly constrained between ~16.2 and 14.2 Ma (Beard, 1996).

We consider the Thumb Member age to be most likely between about 14.2 to 16.4 Ma. Beard (1996) recognized a disconformity to angular unconformity between the Thumb and underlying Rainbow Gardens Members.

Best exposures are at the type locality in the Bitter Ridge area in White Basin where it forms a prominent, very thick south-facing cliff that extends from Lovell Wash eastward to West Longwell Ridge. The member is almost exclusively a distinctive thick- bedded, algal-laminated limestone with teepee structures, oncolitic textures, and stromatolitic bioherms. At Lava Butte the member includes yellowish sandstone with some pebbly beds that interfingers with limestone beds near the top of the section, as well as a 6 m thick tuff bed and thin ash-flow tuff (Castor and others, 2000). The limestone pinches out northward and the unit is represented by the sandstone and tuff until it also pinches out between the Thumb and Lovell Wash Members. Along Lovell Wash the member includes sandstone and mudstone ‘red beds’ in the upper part above the main limestone cliff, overlain by borate-bearing limestone, both of which grade laterally to a conglomeratic facies that records faulting at the basin margin (Bohannon, 1984, Castor, 1993, Anderson, 2003). A similar clastic sequence is found above the main carbonate cliff at White Basin, which is also overlain by borate-bearing limestone. The borate deposits were mined in both the Lovell Wash and White Basin areas in the 1920’s (see Castor, 1993, for greater detail on the borate deposits). Bohannon (1984) placed the age of the Bitter Ridge Limestone at between about 13.5 and 13.0 Ma, based on fission track ages. Castor and others (2000) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 13.07 ± 0.08 Ma for an ash-flow tuff in the Bitter Ridge Limestone obtained south of Lava Butte, but this age is younger than ages they obtained for the ‘overlying’ Lovell Wash Member and they suggested the two members may be at least in part lateral equivalents. Donatelle and others (2005) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 14.32 ± 0.10 Ma (sanidine) from a thick, vitric tuff in the Bitter Ridge Limestone Member in the Echo Wash area.

Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution.

Castor (1993), in a study of borate deposits in the upper part of the Horse Spring Formation, noted that tuffaceous sandstones at the base of the Lovell Wash Member in White Basin and Lovell Wash represented a time-stratigraphic horizon that marks the initial availability of widespread intermediate volcanic detritus. Up to 500 m thick. The Lovell Wash Member is interstratified with the base of the Hamblin volcano in eastern exposures and with other volcanic flows (Thlb) westward towards Frenchman Mountain. Exposed in sigmoidal band from east side of Frenchman Mountain to Callville Wash, then northeastward to White Basin. Although considered younger than Bitter Ridge by Bohannon (1984), more recent work suggests that the Lovell Wash may be in part laterally equivalent to Bitter Ridge Limestone Member (Castor, 1993, Castor and Faulds, 2001). Bohannon (1984) considered the Lovell Wash to range in age from 13.0 to 11.9 Ma. However, Harlan and others (1998) reported 13.28 and 13.17 Ma ages (discussed below) from basalts interbedded with the Lovell Wash in Boulder Basin and suggested it could be at least in part time correlative with the Bitter Ridge Limestone. Castor and others (2000) also reported multiple 40Ar/39Ar ages for tuffs in the Lovell Wash exposed on the east side of Frenchman Mountain that range from 13.40 ± 0.05 (biotite) to 13.12 ± 0.24 (on both plagioclase and hornblende) Ma and indicated they could find no discernable difference in age between the Bitter Ridge and Lovell Wash in the Frenchman Mountain area","The Horse Spring Formation is a pre- to syn-extension basin deposit defined by Longwell (1921, 1922) and divided into four members by Bohannon (1984). The four members are, in descending order, the Lovell Wash, Bitter Ridge Limestone, Thumb, and Rainbow Gardens Members. They range in age from as young as 13 Ma to about 24 Ma or older. Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution. Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005). We consider the revised range of the two upper members to be from 14.3 to 13.0 Ma. Bohannon (1984) bracketed the Thumb Member to be between 17.2 and 13.5 Ma in age. In the south Virgin Mountain area this unit is more tightly constrained between ~16.2 and 14.2 Ma (Beard, 1996). New 40Ar/39Ar dates on sanidine and biotite (Donatelle and others, 2005; Martin, 2005) from the Thumb Member within the Echo Wash area range from 16.4 (biotite) to 14.6 Ma (sanidine). We consider the Thumb Member age to be most likely between about 14.2 to 16.4 Ma. Beard (1996) recognized a disconformity to angular unconformity between the Thumb and underlying Rainbow Gardens Members. Although Bohannon considered the Rainbow Gardens Member to be no older than 20 Ma, Beard (1996) reported 40Ar/39Ar ages ranging from ~26.0 to less than 18.8 Ma in the South Virgin Mountains. Carpenter and others (1989) also reported a K/Ar age on biotite of 24.3 ± 1.0 Ma from a vitric tuff in the Rainbow Gardens Member in the northern Grand Wash trough","Horse Spring Formation, Lovell Wash Member, limestone and sandstone facies","Lovell Wash Member"

Bedding weakly developed or absent. Locally as much as 175 m exposed; total thickness unknown. Clasts are typically locally derived, reflecting composition of nearby source areas. As mapped, upper part of unit is flat-lying to gently tilted and generally onlaps bedrock source areas, burying older faults such as the Gold Butte fault and the Salt Spring Wash fault. In Quail Spring Wash area, the conglomerate facies unconformably overlies conglomeratic Horse Spring age rocks of Overton Arm (Thoc). At this location, a tuff just above the unconformity yielded a preliminary isochron age of 8.9 Ma and the Gold Butte basalt, which is interbedded near the top of the conglomerate, yielded a preliminary age of 9.14 ± 0.05 Ma. A tuff in Thoc below the unconformity yielded an age of 10.94 ± 0.06 Ma (40Ar/39Ar, M. Kunk, written communication, 2000). Extensive outcrops in Temple Basin area overlie older basalt (Tob; ~ 13.3 Ma) and unconformably underlie Hualapai Limestone (Th); clasts indicate deposit mostly derived from Garrett Butte and Hiller Mountains to east. Deposits are coarser on east side of Temple Basin and fine westward. Large breccia deposits (Toab) derived from the east are interbedded within or at base of conglomerate. The lowest part of conglomeratic facies is locally exposed by faulting in the Temple Bar to Gregg Hideout area. About 1 km south of the Lake Mead quadrangle near Gregg Hideout, Blythe (2005) reported 40Ar/39Ar dates of 14.46 ± 0.07 and 13.13 ± 0.53 Ma on tuff near the base of the section, which is tilted as much as 40 degrees and is interlayered with basaltic andesites (Tafb). He also reported an 40Ar/39Ar age of 10.78 ± .4 Ma on a tuff near the top of the section, which is only tilted about 10 degrees. Unlike the Quail Springs Wash area, there is no mapped unconformity in the section, so the lowest part of Toac in the Salt Spring Bay area is equivalent in age to the Horse Spring age rocks to the north and northwest (Thof, Thoc). Conglomerate facies with distinctive mappable clast types indicating source areas are subdivided into Conglomerate facies, bearing Gold Butte Granite clasts (Toacg), Conglomerate facies, bearing limestone clasts (Toacl), Conglomerate facies, bearing volcanic clasts (Toacv), Sandstone, siltstone and mudstone facies (Toas), Gypsiferous facies (Toag), Manganiferous sandstone facies (Toam), and Breccia facies (Toab)","Part of Overton Arm. Deposits not studied in detail; herein are informally grouped as rocks of Overton Arm. Include sandstone, limestone, gypsum and conglomerate, deposited in basin in vicinity of Overton Arm, Virgin Basin and Temple Basin, southeast of the Lake Mead fault system. Largest and stratigraphically highest exposures of limestone are mapped separately as Hualapai Limestone (Th). The eastern margin of basin is defined by highlands of the South Virgin Mountains and Hiller Mountains, where coarse-grained deposits mostly lap onto older rocks. Coarse-grained deposits also lap against southeast side of Cleopatra volcano (Tvc). Western margin of basin is uncertain because rocks are tilted and faulted along the east side of the Black Mountains; however, coarse-grained deposits there suggest western margin was nearby. Basalts intercalated near the top of the conglomerate facies (Toac) are about 8 to 9 Ma (Tb). Locally, in area west of Gold Butte, deposits unconformably overlie Horse Spring-age deposits in Overton Arm.

Anderson (written communication, 2000) reinterpreted the deposit as a Thumb-age angular-clast conglomerate intruded by the pluton. Unit is about 400 m thick","The Horse Spring Formation is a pre- to syn-extension basin deposit defined by Longwell (1921, 1922) and divided into four members by Bohannon (1984). The four members are, in descending order, the Lovell Wash, Bitter Ridge Limestone, Thumb, and Rainbow Gardens Members. They range in age from as young as 13 Ma to about 24 Ma or older. Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution. Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005). We consider the revised range of the two upper members to be from 14.3 to 13.0 Ma. Bohannon (1984) bracketed the Thumb Member to be between 17.2 and 13.5 Ma in age.

Beard (1996) recognized a disconformity to angular unconformity between the Thumb and underlying Rainbow Gardens Members.

The eastern margin of basin is defined by highlands of the South Virgin Mountains and Hiller Mountains, where coarse-grained deposits mostly lap onto older rocks. Coarse-grained deposits also lap against southeast side of Cleopatra volcano (Tvc). Western margin of basin is uncertain because rocks are tilted and faulted along the east side of the Black Mountains; however, coarse-grained deposits there suggest western margin was nearby. Basalts intercalated near the top of the conglomerate facies (Toac) are about 8 to 9 Ma (Tb). Locally, in area west of Gold Butte, deposits unconformably overlie Horse Spring-age deposits in Overton Arm.

Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution. Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005). We consider the revised range of the two upper members to be from 14.3 to 13.0 Ma. Bohannon (1984) bracketed the Thumb Member to be between 17.2 and 13.5 Ma in age. In the south Virgin Mountain area this unit is more tightly constrained between ~16.2 and 14.2 Ma (Beard, 1996). New 40Ar/39Ar dates on sanidine and biotite (Donatelle and others, 2005; Martin, 2005) from the Thumb Member within the Echo Wash area range from 16.4 (biotite) to 14.6 Ma (sanidine). We consider the Thumb Member age to be most likely between about 14.2 to 16.4 Ma. Beard (1996) recognized a disconformity to angular unconformity between the Thumb and underlying Rainbow Gardens Members. Although Bohannon considered the Rainbow Gardens Member to be no older than 20 Ma, Beard (1996) reported 40Ar/39Ar ages ranging from ~26.0 to less than 18.8 Ma in the South Virgin Mountains.

Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005).

Rocks of similar age and tectonic setting to the southeast of the Lake Mead fault system include the informally named Rocks of Overton Arm (defined herein) and Rocks of the Grand Wash trough (Bohannon, 1984) and are described above. Bohannon (1984), Duebendorfer and Wallin (1991) and Anderson (2003) discuss the synvolcanic and basinal tectonic settings of the red sandstone unit and its regional significance. The red sandstone unit is interbedded with and partly correlative to volcanic rocks of Callville Mesa (Duebendorfer, 2003) and is interstratified with the upper flows of Hamblin Mountain volcanic complex (Anderson, 2003). Bohannon (1984) originally defined the age of the red sandstone unit as from 11.9 to 10.6 Ma based on fission track ages. More recent ages obtained on interbedded tuffs and volcanic rocks range from 10.05 ± 0.03 Ma (40Ar/39Ar whole rock age on interbedded basalt flow, Anderson and others, 1994) to at least as old as 11.70 ± 0.08 Ma (40Ar/39Ar on biotite, Harlan and others, 1998) but younger than a 12.93 ± 0.10 Ma age (40Ar/39Ar biotite age, Harlan and others, 1998) obtained on a hornblende biotite dacite clast within a megabreccia block (Trsl). Castor and others (2000) obtained a 40Ar/39Ar date of 11.47 ± 0.05 Ma from a tuff near the base of the unit east of Lava Butte and 11.59 ± 0.06 Ma from a tuff on the north side of Sunrise Mountain. Williams (2003) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 11.72 ± 0.06 Ma for a tuff near Hoover Dam 48 m above the base of a conglomeratic section of the Black Canyon Conglomerate which is herein included with the red sandstone unit. Koski and others (1990) used both fission track and K-Ar techniques on two tuffs associated with the Three Kids manganese deposits at the north end of the River Mountains. The reported ages ranged from 12.4 ±1.1 Ma to 14.0 ± 0.3 Ma which are in the range of the Horse Spring Formation. However, unpublished mapping by R.E.

Faulds and others (2001b; also Wallace and others, 2006) report an 40Ar/39Ar age of 11.08 ± 0.27 Ma and a geochemical correlation age of 10.94 ± 0.05 Ma for a tuff in the lower part of the Hualapai (Tuff of Grapevine Mesa). Tuff in the uppermost part of Hualapai Limestone in its westernmost outcrops just south of the study area yielded an 40Ar/39Ar age of 5.97 ± 0.07 Ma (Spencer and others, 2001). In addition, Wallace and others (2006) report an age of 7.43 ± 0.22 Ma on a tuff interbedded with limestone at Grapevine Mesa in the southeast part of quadrangle. A series of tuff samples from the Hualapai in the south central part of the quadrangle west of Temple Bar did not yield precise 40Ar/39Ar ages, but one contaminated sample yielded a maximum age of 6.87 Ma. This maximum age is strengthened by tephracorrelation ages of 6.27 and 7.0 Ma for tuffs near the top of the section and of about 9-10 Ma for a tuff near the lower part of the section (A. Sarna-Wojcicki, written communication, 2002).

Thickens from east to west, from about 520 m at Azure Ridge to about 630 m at Frenchman Mountain. At Frenchman Mountain, upper part (Frenchman Dolomite of Castor and others, 2000), consists of cliff forming pale-orange weathering, thickly bedded medium- to coarsely crystalline dolomite, underlain by color-banded light- and dark-gray, thin to thick-bedded dolomudstone. Dark bands intensely burrowed and light bands wavy laminated. Lower part is dark-gray and buff-orange, burrow-mottled dolomite, underlain by light and medium-gray limestone and dolomite, with limestone increasing downward in section. Forms stair-step topography. In eastern part of quadrangle, upper part (Unclassified Dolomites of McKee and Resser, 1945) is massive light-gray, medium-grained to coarsely crystalline dolomite, underlain by less resistant white and gray banded unit, with distinctive white, thin-bedded, slope-forming dolomite at base. Forms slope-cliff topography. Lower part is medium- to dark-gray, medium to thin bedded dolomite, interbedded with thin-bedded, light gray sandy dolomite and finely crystalline limestone. Medium to dark-gray beds most common, and are characteristically mottled yellow- gray or light-gray on weathered surface because of intensive burrowing.

Intruded by Wilson Ridge pluton","The Horse Spring Formation is a pre- to syn-extension basin deposit defined by Longwell (1921, 1922) and divided into four members by Bohannon (1984). The four members are, in descending order, the Lovell Wash, Bitter Ridge Limestone, Thumb, and Rainbow Gardens Members. They range in age from as young as 13 Ma to about 24 Ma or older. Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution. Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005). We consider the revised range of the two upper members to be from 14.3 to 13.0 Ma. Bohannon (1984) bracketed the Thumb Member to be between 17.2 and 13.5 Ma in age.

Originally mapped as fault blocks of River Mountain volcanics by Smith (1984) that were overlapped by Muddy Creek Formation. Reinterpreted by R.E. Anderson (written communication, 1997) as landslide and rock avalanche deposits interbedded with conglomerate. May actually be older, equivalent to red sandstone landslide deposits (Trsl)","Part of the Muddy Creek Formation. Mostly sandstone and siltstone but also includes evaporite deposits, limestone, conglomerate, breccia and rarely, tuff. Probably deposited in three separate basins within the quadrangle. Dates from the top of the formation all suggest a minimum age of about 5-6 Ma (see discussion below). Base of section not directly dated, but typically inferred to be younger than the red sandstone unit, about 10 Ma (Bohannon, 1984). Muddy Creek is unconformable on the red sandstone in most exposures, but in unexposed centers of the basins the contact may be gradational. The largest of the basins occurs in the northern part of Overton Arm and is the southern extension of the Muddy Creek basin originally defined in the Moapa-Mesquite area to the north of the Lake Mead quadrangle (Stock, 1921; Bohannon and others, 1993; Schmidt and others, 1996). A basalt flow interbedded near the top of the section at the southern end of this basin, near Overton Beach, is dated at about 6 Ma. A second sedimentary basin centered in the Virgin basin area in the southern part of the quadrangle locally includes Hualapai Limestone (Th) at the top (about 6 Ma). The Hualapai extends eastward from this basin across a bedrock high at Virgin Canyon and is flexed into a hanging-wall anticline against the Wheeler fault. It is possible that this southern basin was physically connected to the main Muddy Creek basin to the north, but bedrock outcrops and lack of Muddy Creek deposits in the intervening area suggest that deposition occurred in a separate basin. The third basin is in the western part of the quadrangle east of Frenchman Mountain where gypsum, limestone, and marl deposits interfinger with marginal sandstone and conglomerate. A tuff near the top of the section has a geochemical correlation age of 5.59 Ma (Tuff of Wolverine Creek; Castor and Faulds, 2001; reported as 6 Ma in Castor and others, 2000). This basin extended both south toward Boulder Basin and northward to Nellis basin (Castor and others, 2000). Large masses of salt (halite) occur in the northern Overton Arm, between Echo Bay and Overton Beach. Salt was originally exposed along the Virgin River, now buried by Lake Mead except for two outcrops south of Overton Beach (Mannion, 1963). The salt body is faulted to the west against the Roger Springs fault; its eastern limit is unknown but probably corresponds to a northeast elongate gravity low in Overton Arm that has been described as a structural pull- apart basin along the Lake Mead fault system. The salt has been inferred to be part of the Muddy Creek Formation, but it is possible that it is part of an older sequence of basin-fill deposits, most likely the Rocks of Overton Arm (Bohannon, 1984). The source of the salt is unknown; Mannion (1963) suggested that the salt was derived from Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks on the Colorado Plateau, deposited by an ancestral Virgin River to the Lake Mead area and deposited in the Overton Arm area.","Muddy Creek Formation, breccia and landslide masses","Muddy Creek Formation"

Best exposures are at the type locality in the Bitter Ridge area in White Basin where it forms a prominent, very thick south-facing cliff that extends from Lovell Wash eastward to West Longwell Ridge. The member is almost exclusively a distinctive thick- bedded, algal-laminated limestone with teepee structures, oncolitic textures, and stromatolitic bioherms. At Lava Butte the member includes yellowish sandstone with some pebbly beds that interfingers with limestone beds near the top of the section, as well as a 6 m thick tuff bed and thin ash-flow tuff (Castor and others, 2000). The limestone pinches out northward and the unit is represented by the sandstone and tuff until it also pinches out between the Thumb and Lovell Wash Members. Along Lovell Wash the member includes sandstone and mudstone ‘red beds’ in the upper part above the main limestone cliff, overlain by borate-bearing limestone, both of which grade laterally to a conglomeratic facies that records faulting at the basin margin (Bohannon, 1984, Castor, 1993, Anderson, 2003). A similar clastic sequence is found above the main carbonate cliff at White Basin, which is also overlain by borate-bearing limestone. The borate deposits were mined in both the Lovell Wash and White Basin areas in the 1920’s (see Castor, 1993, for greater detail on the borate deposits). Bohannon (1984) placed the age of the Bitter Ridge Limestone at between about 13.5 and 13.0 Ma, based on fission track ages. Castor and others (2000) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 13.07 ± 0.08 Ma for an ash-flow tuff in the Bitter Ridge Limestone obtained south of Lava Butte, but this age is younger than ages they obtained for the ‘overlying’ Lovell Wash Member and they suggested the two members may be at least in part lateral equivalents. Donatelle and others (2005) reported a 40Ar/39Ar age of 14.32 ± 0.10 Ma (sanidine) from a thick, vitric tuff in the Bitter Ridge Limestone Member in the Echo Wash area. This is within the upper age range of the Thumb Member and suggests that the lower Bitter Ridge may be the same age as the uppermost Thumb Member in other areas","The Horse Spring Formation is a pre- to syn-extension basin deposit defined by Longwell (1921, 1922) and divided into four members by Bohannon (1984). The four members are, in descending order, the Lovell Wash, Bitter Ridge Limestone, Thumb, and Rainbow Gardens Members. They range in age from as young as 13 Ma to about 24 Ma or older. Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution. Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005). We consider the revised range of the two upper members to be from 14.3 to 13.0 Ma. Bohannon (1984) bracketed the Thumb Member to be between 17.2 and 13.5 Ma in age. In the south Virgin Mountain area this unit is more tightly constrained between ~16.2 and 14.2 Ma (Beard, 1996).

We consider the Thumb Member age to be most likely between about 14.2 to 16.4 Ma. Beard (1996) recognized a disconformity to angular unconformity between the Thumb and underlying Rainbow Gardens Members. Although Bohannon considered the Rainbow Gardens Member to be no older than 20 Ma, Beard (1996) reported 40Ar/39Ar ages ranging from ~26.0 to less than 18.8 Ma in the South Virgin Mountains.

Faulds and others (2001b; also Wallace and others, 2006) report an 40Ar/39Ar age of 11.08 ± 0.27 Ma and a geochemical correlation age of 10.94 ± 0.05 Ma for a tuff in the lower part of the Hualapai (Tuff of Grapevine Mesa). Tuff in the uppermost part of Hualapai Limestone in its westernmost outcrops just south of the study area yielded an 40Ar/39Ar age of 5.97 ± 0.07 Ma (Spencer and others, 2001). In addition, Wallace and others (2006) report an age of 7.43 ± 0.22 Ma on a tuff interbedded with limestone at Grapevine Mesa in the southeast part of quadrangle. A series of tuff samples from the Hualapai in the south central part of the quadrangle west of Temple Bar did not yield precise 40Ar/39Ar ages, but one contaminated sample yielded a maximum age of 6.87 Ma.

The eastern margin of basin is defined by highlands of the South Virgin Mountains and Hiller Mountains, where coarse-grained deposits mostly lap onto older rocks. Coarse-grained deposits also lap against southeast side of Cleopatra volcano (Tvc). Western margin of basin is uncertain because rocks are tilted and faulted along the east side of the Black Mountains; however, coarse-grained deposits there suggest western margin was nearby. Basalts intercalated near the top of the conglomerate facies (Toac) are about 8 to 9 Ma (Tb). Locally, in area west of Gold Butte, deposits unconformably overlie Horse Spring-age deposits in Overton Arm. However, elsewhere in basin the basal part of unit is older and is probably laterally equivalent to the Horse Spring rocks (Plate 2).","Rocks of Overton Arm, sandstone, siltstone and mudstone facies","Overton Arm"

Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution. Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005). We consider the revised range of the two upper members to be from 14.3 to 13.0 Ma. Bohannon (1984) bracketed the Thumb Member to be between 17.2 and 13.5 Ma in age.

Mostly sandstone and siltstone but also includes evaporite deposits, limestone, conglomerate, breccia and rarely, tuff. Probably deposited in three separate basins within the quadrangle. Dates from the top of the formation all suggest a minimum age of about 5-6 Ma (see discussion below). Base of section not directly dated, but typically inferred to be younger than the red sandstone unit, about 10 Ma (Bohannon, 1984). Muddy Creek is unconformable on the red sandstone in most exposures, but in unexposed centers of the basins the contact may be gradational. The largest of the basins occurs in the northern part of Overton Arm and is the southern extension of the Muddy Creek basin originally defined in the Moapa-Mesquite area to the north of the Lake Mead quadrangle (Stock, 1921; Bohannon and others, 1993; Schmidt and others, 1996). A basalt flow interbedded near the top of the section at the southern end of this basin, near Overton Beach, is dated at about 6 Ma. A second sedimentary basin centered in the Virgin basin area in the southern part of the quadrangle locally includes Hualapai Limestone (Th) at the top (about 6 Ma). The Hualapai extends eastward from this basin across a bedrock high at Virgin Canyon and is flexed into a hanging-wall anticline against the Wheeler fault. It is possible that this southern basin was physically connected to the main Muddy Creek basin to the north, but bedrock outcrops and lack of Muddy Creek deposits in the intervening area suggest that deposition occurred in a separate basin. The third basin is in the western part of the quadrangle east of Frenchman Mountain where gypsum, limestone, and marl deposits interfinger with marginal sandstone and conglomerate. A tuff near the top of the section has a geochemical correlation age of 5.59 Ma (Tuff of Wolverine Creek; Castor and Faulds, 2001; reported as 6 Ma in Castor and others, 2000). This basin extended both south toward Boulder Basin and northward to Nellis basin (Castor and others, 2000). Large masses of salt (halite) occur in the northern Overton Arm, between Echo Bay and Overton Beach. Salt was originally exposed along the Virgin River, now buried by Lake Mead except for two outcrops south of Overton Beach (Mannion, 1963). The salt body is faulted to the west against the Roger Springs fault; its eastern limit is unknown but probably corresponds to a northeast elongate gravity low in Overton Arm that has been described as a structural pull- apart basin along the Lake Mead fault system. The salt has been inferred to be part of the Muddy Creek Formation, but it is possible that it is part of an older sequence of basin-fill deposits, most likely the Rocks of Overton Arm (Bohannon, 1984). The source of the salt is unknown; Mannion (1963) suggested that the salt was derived from Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks on the Colorado Plateau, deposited by an ancestral Virgin River to the Lake Mead area and deposited in the Overton Arm area.","Muddy Creek Formation, gypsum facies","Muddy Creek Formation"

Where full section is exposed comprises three lithostratigraphic units (not mapped separately): a capping limestone, a middle slope- forming sequence, and a basal conglomerate. Age ranges from younger than 18.8 Ma to older than 26 Ma (Beard, 1996). Upper limestone unit is white to reddish-white, coarsely crystalline limestone; poorly bedded, locally brecciated, locally vuggy with white, coarsely crystalline laminated infillings. Base of the unit typically contains abundant calcite filled tubes (Bohannon, 1984; Beard, 1996) that are probably root casts. In the Virgin Mountains, contact with overlying Thumb is erosional unconformity. There, upper surface of Rainbow Gardens is manganese coated karstic white sparry limestone breccia. Karst surface is locally infilled by reddish siltstone and karst-clast conglomerate of overlying Thumb. Elsewhere, break is marked by abrupt change from reddish massive limestone to algal laminated limestone of Thumb (Thtl) (Beard, 1996). Middle slope-forming unit, of variable thickness, is complex intertonguing sequence of clastic and carbonate lithofacies with abundant volcaniclastic and pyroclastic material in northern and eastern outcrops (Beard, 1996). Clastic rocks vary from pebbly lithic to volcaniclastic sandstones. Lithic sandstone beds are commonly orange-pink to reddish brown and are structureless, unsorted, and matrix supported. Volcaniclastic sandstones are pale gray or greenish gray, pebbly, and commonly exhibit planar or trough cross-stratification. Carbonate lithofacies rocks are typically thin-bedded calcareous mudstone to micrite that alternate with recessive claystone; thin white airfall tuffs are common. Basal conglomerate is dark-brown to red-brown, pebble to cobble conglomerate, composed mostly of sub-angular to sub-rounded, poorly- to non-imbricated, Paleozoic carbonate and chert clasts, in calcareous, sandy matrix. Locally includes sandy channels with well-rounded pebbles recycled from underlying Mesozoic rocks.

Brown chert is locally common as thin beds to irregularly shaped masses. Tuff and tuffaceous sandstone beds are a meter to tens of meters thick. Castor (1993), in a study of borate deposits in the upper part of the Horse Spring Formation, noted that tuffaceous sandstones at the base of the Lovell Wash Member in White Basin and Lovell Wash represented a time-stratigraphic horizon that marks the initial availability of widespread intermediate volcanic detritus.

Exposed in sigmoidal band from east side of Frenchman Mountain to Callville Wash, then northeastward to White Basin. Although considered younger than Bitter Ridge by Bohannon (1984), more recent work suggests that the Lovell Wash may be in part laterally equivalent to Bitter Ridge Limestone Member (Castor, 1993, Castor and Faulds, 2001). Bohannon (1984) considered the Lovell Wash to range in age from 13.0 to 11.9 Ma. However, Harlan and others (1998) reported 13.28 and 13.17 Ma ages (discussed below) from basalts interbedded with the Lovell Wash in Boulder Basin and suggested it could be at least in part time correlative with the Bitter Ridge Limestone.

The four members are, in descending order, the Lovell Wash, Bitter Ridge Limestone, Thumb, and Rainbow Gardens Members. They range in age from as young as 13 Ma to about 24 Ma or older. Geochronologic data published since Bohannon (1984) originally defined the Horse Spring Formation members indicates that the stratigraphic relations between the members are quite complex, because deposition was mostly syntectonic with basin evolution. Although Bohannon originally defined the Lovell Wash Member as about 13 to 12 Ma and Bitter Ridge Member as 13.5 to 13 Ma, more recent geochronologic data have suggested that the upper part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to the Lovell Wash Member, and the lower part of the Bitter Ridge Member may be time correlative to upper parts of the Thumb Member (Castor and others, 2000, Lamb and others, 2005). We consider the revised range of the two upper members to be from 14.3 to 13.0 Ma. Bohannon (1984) bracketed the Thumb Member to be between 17.2 and 13.5 Ma in age.

Where full section is exposed comprises three lithostratigraphic units (not mapped separately): a capping limestone, a middle slope- forming sequence, and a basal conglomerate. Age ranges from younger than 18.8 Ma to older than 26 Ma (Beard, 1996). Upper limestone unit is white to reddish-white, coarsely crystalline limestone; poorly bedded, locally brecciated, locally vuggy with white, coarsely crystalline laminated infillings. Base of the unit typically contains abundant calcite filled tubes (Bohannon, 1984; Beard, 1996) that are probably root casts. In the Virgin Mountains, contact with overlying Thumb is erosional unconformity. There, upper surface of Rainbow Gardens is manganese coated karstic white sparry limestone breccia. Karst surface is locally infilled by reddish siltstone and karst-clast conglomerate of overlying Thumb. Elsewhere, break is marked by abrupt change from reddish massive limestone to algal laminated limestone of Thumb (Thtl) (Beard, 1996). Middle slope-forming unit, of variable thickness, is complex intertonguing sequence of clastic and carbonate lithofacies with abundant volcaniclastic and pyroclastic material in northern and eastern outcrops (Beard, 1996). Clastic rocks vary from pebbly lithic to volcaniclastic sandstones. Lithic sandstone beds are commonly orange-pink to reddish brown and are structureless, unsorted, and matrix supported. Volcaniclastic sandstones are pale gray or greenish gray, pebbly, and commonly exhibit planar or trough cross-stratification. Carbonate lithofacies rocks are typically thin-bedded calcareous mudstone to micrite that alternate with recessive claystone; thin white airfall tuffs are common. Basal conglomerate is dark-brown to red-brown, pebble to cobble conglomerate, composed mostly of sub-angular to sub-rounded, poorly- to non-imbricated, Paleozoic carbonate and chert clasts, in calcareous, sandy matrix. Locally includes sandy channels with well-rounded pebbles recycled from underlying Mesozoic rocks.
